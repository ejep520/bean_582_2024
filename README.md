## Pre-requisites
* An IDE - [Eclipse](https://eclipseide.org/), [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
* [BellSoft Liberica JDK version 17](https://bell-sw.com/pages/downloads/#jdk-17-lts)
* [JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/)

## Running this project
* Step by step instructions for running this project starting at git clone
* 
## Introduction
This is a demostration project of an apartment finder web portal.

## Requirements
### Narrative
This project is a web portal for finding availiable apartments for rent.

### Functional
* As an owner I want to be able to have my listings "featured" before others
  * Featured meaning the featured apartments are shown first on the main landing page and on search pages.
  *  These could be done in a priority (who pays the most) or character set order (alphabetical).
* As a shopper I want to search for an apartment with given search criteria 
  * For example: postal code, number of bedrooms, size, bathrooms, ammenities
* As a shopper I want to view an apartment floorplan
* As a shopper I want to see interior views of an apartment
* As a shopper I want to send an apartment complex an inquiry message
* Stretch: As a shopper I want to maintain a list of favorited units. This data could be stored in a cookie.
* As a developer/tester I want a testable code base
  * Key UI components should have a x-name or name attribute for test to locate programmatically

### Exclusions
* User accounts and user maintenance are excluded in order to simplify the project for the tight deliverable. Project data is static content used for the demonstration purposes. If time permits, this feature may be pulled in.

## Test
[Junit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/) and [Selenium](https://selenium.dev) will be used for automated test cases.
* Unit testing. Individual units of testable code must have a corresponding unit test. Mocking may be used appropriate
* Functional tests
  * API Testing
    * APIs may be needed to facilitate testing. These must be such that authorization is required with a fixed token
  * Integration Testing
  * UI Integration Testing
    * UI Testing will be accomplished using [Selenium](https://selenium.dev) to provide programmatic control of the UI to simulate the end user's behaviors.
    * UI Test scripts should not be one monolithic script. Each script should accomplish one use case
* Tests
  * Are "paid to promote" prioritization listed correctly?
  * Do searches return the proper properties?
    * I want all apartments with 3+ bedrooms. Do all the appropriate apartments get returned
  * The correct floorplan image is returned. This may just be a URL that can be made to the src attribute of an <image> element
  * Are the correct interior images returned?
  * Are favorited properties maintained?

// TODO:

* Show graphs, tables, and UML
